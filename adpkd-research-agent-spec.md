# ADPKD Research Intelligence System — Build Specification

## Purpose

Build a personal research intelligence system that continuously tracks scientific developments in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). The system runs locally on a Mac Mini, uses Claude Code with `--loop` for autonomous research, stores structured data locally, and syncs synthesized output to Google Drive.

## Agent Prompts

### Scan Mode Prompt (scan.md)

```markdown
# ADPKD Research Scanner

You are a research intelligence agent monitoring scientific developments in
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).

## Your Task

Perform a SCAN — a lightweight check for new publications and trial updates.

## Steps

1. **Load current state**
   - Read `~/adpkd-research/data/papers.json` to know what you already have
   - Read `~/adpkd-research/data/trials.json` for current trial tracking
   - Note the date of the last successful run from `run-log.json`

2. **Search for new papers**
   Use curl to query the Semantic Scholar API for recent ADPKD papers:

   ```bash
   # Primary search — recent papers
   curl -s "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=ADPKD+polycystic+kidney&year=2025-2026&limit=20&fields=title,authors,abstract,journal,publicationDate,externalIds,url" | jq .

   # Targeted searches for specific subtopics
   curl -s "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=ADPKD+tolvaptan&year=2025-2026&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,journal,publicationDate,externalIds,url" | jq .
   curl -s "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=ADPKD+ketogenic+diet&year=2025-2026&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,journal,publicationDate,externalIds,url" | jq .
   curl -s "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=polycystic+kidney+clinical+trial&year=2025-2026&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,journal,publicationDate,externalIds,url" | jq .
   curl -s "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=PKD1+PKD2+gene+therapy&year=2025-2026&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,journal,publicationDate,externalIds,url" | jq .
   ```

3. **Deduplicate** — compare against existing paper IDs in papers.json

4. **Assess each new paper**
   For each genuinely new paper:
   - Assign dimensions and subtopics from the taxonomy
   - Score relevance (1-10) based on:
     - Direct ADPKD focus (not just CKD in general): +3
     - Clinical trial results: +3
     - Novel treatment mechanism: +2
     - Dietary/lifestyle intervention: +2
     - Human data (vs animal models): +2
     - Review/meta-analysis of existing data: +1
   - Write a brief novelty assessment
   - Extract key findings in plain language
   - Note clinical implications

5. **Check for trial updates**
   For each tracked trial in trials.json, check ClinicalTrials.gov:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies/NCT04680780" | jq '.protocolSection.statusModule'
   ```
   Note any status changes, new results, or enrollment updates.

6. **Update data files**
   - Append new papers to papers.json
   - Update trials.json with any changes
   - Log the run in run-log.json

7. **Generate alerts**
   If any paper scores relevance >= 8, or any trial changes phase/status:
   - Write a brief alert to `~/adpkd-research/output/alerts/YYYY-MM-DD-alert.md`
   - Include: what happened, why it matters, link to source

## Rules
- Do NOT update synthesis documents (findings.json or knowledge base docs) — that's for deep analysis mode
- Be conservative with relevance scores — not everything mentioning kidneys is relevant
- If a paper is about ARPKD (autosomal recessive), note it but score lower unless findings apply to ADPKD
- If the Semantic Scholar API is rate-limited, wait and retry (max 3 retries)
- Always validate JSON before writing files
```

### Deep Analysis Mode Prompt (deep.md)

```markdown
# ADPKD Deep Research Analyst

You are a research intelligence agent performing a DEEP ANALYSIS of the
ADPKD research landscape.

## Your Task

Synthesize recent findings, update the knowledge base, cross-reference
new data against existing understanding, and produce a weekly digest.

## Steps

1. **Load full state**
   - Read ALL files in `~/adpkd-research/data/`
   - Understand the current state of knowledge across all six dimensions
   - Identify papers with status "new" (not yet incorporated into synthesis)

2. **Cross-reference new papers**
   For each unincorporated paper:
   - Does it confirm, extend, or contradict existing findings?
   - Does it introduce a genuinely new angle?
   - Are there connections between papers across different dimensions?
     (e.g., a ketogenic diet paper that also measures biomarkers)

3. **Update findings.json**
   - Add new findings or update existing ones
   - Adjust confidence levels based on accumulating evidence
   - Track the evolution of understanding over time
   - Mark papers as "incorporated" in papers.json

4. **Deeper investigation**
   If a new paper is particularly significant (relevance >= 8):
   - Search for related papers by the same authors
   - Search for papers citing the same key references
   - Look for pre-prints or conference presentations with newer data
   - Check if any trials are based on this work

5. **Generate weekly digest**
   Write `~/adpkd-research/output/digests/YYYY-WXX-digest.md`:

   ```markdown
   # ADPKD Research Digest — Week XX, YYYY

   ## Highlights
   [Most significant new findings this week — max 3 items]

   ## New Papers
   [Brief summary of each new paper added, grouped by dimension]

   ## Trial Updates
   [Any changes in tracked clinical trials]

   ## Evolving Understanding
   [How this week's findings shift or reinforce the overall picture]

   ## Watchlist
   [Upcoming trial readouts, conferences, or expected publications]

   ## Data Summary
   - Papers tracked: N total (X new this week)
   - Trials monitored: N (X with updates)
   - Findings updated: X
   ```

6. **Sync to Google Drive**
   Run the sync script to push updated content:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/adpkd-research/scripts/sync.py
   ```

7. **Update knowledge base documents**
   For each dimension where findings changed, update the corresponding
   markdown file in `~/adpkd-research/output/knowledge-base/`:
   - `01-pharmacological-treatments.md`
   - `02-dietary-lifestyle.md`
   - `03-genetics-biomarkers.md`
   - `04-clinical-trials-pipeline.md`
   - `05-disease-management.md`
   - `06-patient-community.md`

   Each document should be a living synthesis — not a list of papers,
   but a coherent narrative of what is currently known, what's uncertain,
   and what's emerging. Include dates so the reader knows how current
   the information is.

## Rules
- Always preserve the evolution history in findings — never overwrite, always append
- When confidence changes, explain why in the evolution log
- Be honest about uncertainty — "promising but preliminary" is better than overstating
- Note when findings are from animal models vs human data
- Flag potential conflicts of interest if obvious (e.g., pharma-sponsored trials)
- The knowledge base documents should be readable by a motivated patient,
  not just researchers — use plain language where possible, with technical
  terms explained
```

## Initial Baseline Prompt (baseline.md)

This runs ONCE to establish the current state of knowledge.

```markdown
# ADPKD Research Baseline Builder

You are building the initial knowledge base for an ADPKD research tracking
system. This is a comprehensive one-time sweep.

## Your Task

Establish the current state of ADPKD research across all six dimensions
of the taxonomy. This will serve as the foundation for ongoing monitoring.

## Steps

1. **Create directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/adpkd-research/{data,prompts,output/{digests,alerts,knowledge-base},scripts}
   ```

2. **Comprehensive paper search**
   Search Semantic Scholar for the most important recent ADPKD papers.
   Cast a wide net — you're building the baseline.

   Search queries to run (with year filter 2023-2026 for recency,
   but also grab landmark papers regardless of date):

   - "ADPKD treatment clinical trial"
   - "ADPKD tolvaptan long term"
   - "ADPKD ketogenic diet"
   - "ADPKD metformin"
   - "ADPKD SGLT2 inhibitor"
   - "ADPKD GLP-1"
   - "PKD1 PKD2 gene therapy CRISPR"
   - "ADPKD total kidney volume biomarker"
   - "ADPKD progression prediction"
   - "polycystic kidney disease dietary intervention"
   - "ADPKD clinical practice guideline"
   - "VX-407 ADPKD" (Vertex PKD1 corrector)
   - "ADPKD miR-17 microRNA"
   - "ADPKD caloric restriction intermittent fasting"
   - "ADPKD proteomics biomarker"

   For each search, use limit=30 to get comprehensive coverage.

3. **Build the initial trials.json**
   Search ClinicalTrials.gov for active ADPKD trials:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies?query.cond=ADPKD&filter.overallStatus=RECRUITING,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION&pageSize=50" | jq .
   ```

4. **Build initial findings.json**
   Based on the papers found, establish the current consensus and
   open questions for each dimension. Be thorough — this is the
   foundation everything builds on.

5. **Write initial knowledge base documents**
   Create all six knowledge base documents with comprehensive
   current-state summaries.

6. **Initialize run-log.json** with this baseline run.

7. **Generate the first digest** summarizing the baseline state.

## Important Notes
- This will be a long run — take your time, be thorough
- Prioritize quality over speed
- For landmark papers (e.g., TEMPO 3:4 tolvaptan trial, HALT-PKD),
  include them even if older — they're foundational
- Note the KDIGO 2025 guideline as a key reference
- Identify the most active research groups and institutions
- Flag any papers from Dutch institutions (University of Amsterdam,
  Radboud, Erasmus MC, etc.) — these may be locally relevant
```

## Setup Instructions (for Claude Code)

Run these steps in order:

### 1. Create directory structure
```bash
mkdir -p ~/adpkd-research/{data,prompts,output/{digests,alerts,knowledge-base,logs},scripts}
```

### 2. Copy prompt files
Place `scan.md`, `deep.md`, and `baseline.md` into `~/adpkd-research/prompts/`

### 3. Copy and configure scripts
Place `scan.sh`, `deep.sh`, and `sync.py` into `~/adpkd-research/scripts/`
Make scripts executable: `chmod +x ~/adpkd-research/scripts/*.sh`
Update YOUR_USERNAME in all files.

### 4. Configure Google Drive sync
- If Google Drive for Desktop is installed: verify the mount path in `sync.py`
- If not: install `rclone` and configure a Google Drive remote, then update `sync.py`

### 5. Install launchd plists
```bash
cp com.adpkd.scan.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
cp com.adpkd.deep.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.adpkd.scan.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.adpkd.deep.plist
```

### 6. Run the baseline
```bash
cd ~/adpkd-research
claude --loop \
  --allowedTools "Bash(read:*),Bash(write:~/adpkd-research/*),Bash(net:api.semanticscholar.org),Bash(net:clinicaltrials.gov)" \
  -p "$(cat prompts/baseline.md)"
```
This will take a while — it builds the complete initial knowledge base.

### 7. Verify
- Check that `data/*.json` files are populated
- Check that `output/knowledge-base/*.md` files exist
- Check that Google Drive sync works
- Verify launchd schedules: `launchctl list | grep adpkd`

## Frontend Dashboard (Phase 2)

Once the data pipeline is running, build a simple dashboard. Options:

### Option A: React Artifact (quick prototype)
Build in Claude.ai as a React artifact that reads from a JSON file.
Good for prototyping the layout and interactions.

### Option B: Local HTML + Google Sheets API
A single HTML page that reads from a Google Sheet (published as CSV).
Can be served locally or hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Option C: Simple Markdown Site
Use a static site generator (Astro, 11ty) to render the knowledge base
markdown files as a browsable website. Lowest maintenance.

### Dashboard Should Show:
- Research landscape overview (6 dimensions with status indicators)
- Timeline of recent findings
- Clinical trials pipeline visualization
- Paper count and trend by dimension
- Alerts and significant findings
- Link to full knowledge base documents

## Notes & Considerations

### Token Usage
- Scan mode: estimated ~10-20k tokens per run (3x/week = ~45-60k/week)
- Deep analysis: estimated ~30-60k tokens per run (1x/week)
- Baseline: estimated ~100-200k tokens (one-time)
- Total weekly: roughly ~75-120k tokens — well within Max limits

### API Rate Limits
- Semantic Scholar: 100 requests per 5 minutes (unauthenticated)
  - Request an API key (free) for higher limits if needed
  - https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api
- ClinicalTrials.gov: No strict rate limit but be respectful

### Data Freshness
- Semantic Scholar indexes papers within days of publication
- ClinicalTrials.gov is updated by sponsors (can lag)
- PubMed could be added as a secondary source if coverage gaps appear

### Future Enhancements
- Add PubMed/MEDLINE search via E-utilities API
- Email digest delivery (Gmail integration)
- Slack notifications for high-relevance alerts
- Citation graph analysis (which papers cite which)
- Author tracking (follow specific researchers)
- Integration with Zotero or Paperpile for paper management
- Conference calendar integration
```
